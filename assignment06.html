      		<p>This is my future dream home in Santa Monica. I'm a big fan of contemporary architecture with white exteriors/interiors and clean lines. This house is in an ideal location for access to the tech  and entertainment industry; two industries that really interest me. Southern California is such a productive and beautiful place to live. Also, you can't get any better than having a mansion with a view of the ocean, I mean, come on.</p>

        	<img id="column2" src="images/Tesla-2.jpg" alt="White Tesla Model S">
        	<p>The white Tesla Model S is my dream car. It's a fully-electric vehicle with the perks (and price) of a luxury sports car; it's stylish, fast, and economical. Because it doesn't have a gas-guzzling engine, it doesn't make any noise when you drive it around... it's like a ghost-car.</p>
