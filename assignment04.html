      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Originally from Boston, I moved here to Southern California 15 years ago so that my family could escape the freezing cold winters. However, unlike my family, I love the cold and the snow and I miss being in New England. Oh yeah, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/sports/football/patriots-win-super-bowl-xlix-defeating-seahawks.html">go Patriots!</a></p>

      <p>I like to label myself as a hybrid between a geek and a nerd, as I love video games, tech, anime, and learning. But I also have a very girly side; I'm really into fashion and beauty. It seems to me that I'm a unicorn, as I'm the only one of my kind that I know of!</p><br>
